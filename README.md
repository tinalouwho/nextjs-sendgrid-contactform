This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The purpose of this repo is to create a Contact Form with front-end validation and integrates SendGrid for recienving emails containing the data and messages sent through the contact form to the owner.

Written in Typescript and styled with TailwindCSS.
Other installations - Tailwind forms and email validator.

## Getting Started

First, sign up for a free account on SendGrid and Twilio.

Navigate to your dashboard. Verify a Single Sender and authenticate.

Then, select Email API from the left side-bar and follow the integration guide.

Replace the API key in the .env with yours.

Now, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
